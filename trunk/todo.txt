Notes:
===============
* All system classes will be pre-compiled and execute VM instructions
* Traps will used for OS specific directives
* Need a way to write, pre-compile and store instructions for system classes
* Can tracing JIT call call into functions?
  - Types can change callee code
  - locals (parameters), instance variables
  
Memory managment:
[class name(ptr)][type(bit)][cache size(long)][marker(bit)][<-- bock o' memory -->]
 
  
* Have a single List class or Array and List (linked-list) classes?
  
List Class:
---------------
New - Will create a new array i.e. NEW_ARRAY (operands); if link-list based NEW_OBJ for a node
Add -
Remove - ?
Insert - ?
