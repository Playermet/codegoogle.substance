- Parsing function and method calls
* Add support for arrays
* Implement garbage collection
-----------
list (operate from both ends)
hash (name/value)
-----------

==========================
Goal:
Have libraries compile down to native code.  Have built-in syntax for lists and hashes.  This can be done if C/C++ code is used to implement system classes.

compile time:
1) load/process system source
2) store vm instructions in binary / libraries

pipeline
1) load system source?
-or-
1) system classes part of binary / libaries
